// // TCP / IP

// // Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol

// // A four layer model to breakdown how data is transferred from one computer to another on the internet

// // Layer 1: Link/Physical
// // - responsible for turning bit streams 1 or 0 into something that can be physically transferred through wire
// // - how to transport data from node to node
// // Layer 2: Internet
// // - responsible for getting data to a destination
// // - protocol used to identify every computer in a network and is also used to determine what route data should go to reach it's destination
// // - IPv4 address is a four byte number used to uniquely identify a computer
// // - Totally it has around 4.3 billion unique addresses. But this is not enough for the entire world now
// // - IPv6
// // - IPv6 is the newer IPv4
// // - An IPv6 address is made up of 128 bits. IPv6 addresses are four 16-bit address. So every number can go up to ~65,000. It uses hexadecimal which is a base 16 number 0 - 9 A 10B - 11 F - 15 ....
// // - IPv6 has 3.4 * 10 ^ 38 addresses


// traceroute

// DNS - Domain Name Service

// Because we don't want to memorize IP addresses, we use a DNS to create a "nickname" for the domain address.

// DNS services have a dictionary that knows which domain name belongs to what ip address eg. codecore.ca => has the address of => 205.144.171.150

//you can use the command "host <domain_name>" to find out the IP address of a domain name

// Layer 3: Transport

// -Responsible for turning a larger resource into small pieces called packets
// - Responsible for reconstructing the packets back into the larger resource at the destination

// TCP - Transmission Control Protocol

// - A resource is split up into multiple packets
// - A packet has 3 parts
//   -Header: holds information used to error check & info on how to assemble the packets back into the original resource
//   -Body / Payload: The actual data that needs to be transported
//   -Footer: Information to end the packet
// -Reliable
// -Packets are ordered
// -Packets are error checked
// -Connection based  

// Ports
// - Ports can be thought of as doors that you computer can open and close when it needs to send information or receive information from the internet
// - Every application that is running requires a port e.g. psql => 5432

// UDP - User Datagram Protocol
// -Unreliable
// -No order checking
// - connectionless
// - faster than TCP

// Servers and Clients
// - A client is a computer that is requesting / sending a resource
// - A server is a computer that responds to incoming requests

// // Layer: 4
// - This is the layer that we work with the most as web developers
// - This is where application like(browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari...) work in
// - It's responsible for fetching resources. It will turn images into an encoded format

// HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol
// - used to sent text between clients and servers
// - has built in verbs to describe requests(GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE...)
// - has built in response codes for extra information(200->ok, 404->not found, 500-> internal server error)
// - uses a combination of verbs url's and paths to get resources from servers

// TCP / IP as whole. Sending a image to Facebook

// 1. User uploads an image on the application layer (layer 4)
// 2. The application turns this image into encoded text format and sends it using HTTP (layer 3)
// 3. TCP will break up the encoded text into multiple packets
// 4. Defines rules on how to re-build the packets at the destination (layer 2)
// 5. IPv4 will route packets from the origin to the destination (layer 1)
// 6 Changing the encoded text into a physical form that can be transported through a wire
